# tbp-overlay-cider-bridge

## Development

this project uses [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) 🦀🚀🦀🚀🦀🚀 because it's written in 🦀🚀🦀🚀 rust 🦀🚀🦀🚀 and therefore it's ☄️🔥⌛ blazingly fast 🦀🚀 and is less 🦀🚀 of a headache 🦀🚀 than pip 😢🐍 is ~~honestly if it were up to me i'd use deno with typescript but i'm used to python as is my curse~~

download it and execute `rye run setup` in your terminal of choice (i recommend [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as it is also written in 🦀🚀🦀🚀 rust 🦀🚀🦀🚀)

## TODO
- if this is going to be used by other people maybe *don't* have them download more than just python 3.12.3
    - it might. it's just a script. please don't overinvent the wheel.
    - `config.py` over .env; write a batch script that does most of the heavy lifting
